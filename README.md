Enable better integration between the Oh The Biomes You'll Go mod and Minecolonies


Datapack from Shadizar to enable better integration between the Oh The Biomes You'll Go mod and Minecolonies.

Includes handling of the modded logs, crafting of items (high end tools/armor gated behind suitable research), pathblocks, and florist integration. (Your florist can grow something like 60 more flowers...if you prefer to limit that, delete or edit the florist_flowers.json before using.)

This is tested on Oh_The_Biomes_You'll_Go-forge-1.19.2-2.0.0.13 and later; datapack is untested on prior versions of BYG.
